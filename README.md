# Emotion Prediction with WebRtc

Extensive possibilities of applications have made emotion recognition ineluctable and challenging in the field of computer science.

Humans interact socially with the help of emotions, which are considered as a universal language.

These emotions surpass cultural diversities and ethnicity. 

Facial expressions are responsible for conveying the information, which was difficult to perceive.

As a result, automatic recognition of emotion in a variety of areas such as image processing, cybersecurity, robotics, psychological studies, and virtual reality applications.

Hence, building a system that is capable of both face detection and emotion recognition has been a crucial area of research.

# Emotions

It is a well-established fact that human beings are responsible for the depiction of six basic emotions, such as

  - happiness 
  - anger 
  - surprise
  - sadness 
  - fear 
  - disgust

Apart from these basic emotions, several other emotions have been considered for research. such as

  - contempt
  - envy
  - pain
  - drowsiness

# Workflow

- Feature selection
    - This stage refers to attribute selection for the training of the machine learning algorithm. The process includes the selection of predictors for construction of the learning system.
- Feature classification
    - Classification is where one comes up with new examples and, hence, assigning them to the classes that are already made through training the features.
- Feature extraction
    - Machine learning requires numerical data for learning and training. During feature extraction, processing is done to transform arbitrary data, text or images, to gather the numerical data.
- Classifiers
    - This is the final step in this process. Based on the inference from the features, the algorithm performs data classification.
